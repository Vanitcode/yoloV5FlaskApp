#Yolov5 object detection model in flaskThis repo is a fork of [robmarkcole](https://github.com/robmarkcole/yolov5-flask). I have used this previous work to add some functionalities with flask. The objective of this repo is that I can learn how to use flask and review some concepts about deep learning.## Next functionalities to implement- Rescale the image processed by the model.- Control the format of the image given by the user.- Give color and animations.
