# Yolov5 object detection model in flaskThis repo is a fork of [robmarkcole](https://github.com/robmarkcole/yolov5-flask). I have used this previous work to add some functionalities with flask. The objective of this repo is that I can learn how to use flask and review some concepts about deep learning.## Next functionalities to implement1. ~~Control the format of the image given by the user.~~2. ~~Rescale the image processed by the model.~~3. ~~Apply some CSS style.~~## Solutions to the functionalities:1. Format of the image: function *allowed_file()*. This function has been provided by [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/patterns/fileuploads/) Also, flash() function has been implemented in order to give feedback to the users.2. Rescale the image: function *mg.resize()* taking in account the aspect ratio.3. Apply CSS: the *result.html* template has been styled by CSS. Image and Index button are centered and well placed.
